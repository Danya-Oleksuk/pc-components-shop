## üöÄ **Run with Docker**

If you prefer to use Docker for setting up your environment, you can follow these steps. Docker provides a more isolated and convenient way to run the project.

### 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danya-Oleksuk/pc-components-shop
cd pc-components-shop
```

### 2. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

If you don‚Äôt have Docker installed, follow the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### 3. Build and start the containers:

In the root directory of your project, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will:

- Build the Docker images for the project and its dependencies.
- Start the services in the background.

### 4. Apply database migrations:

Once the containers are up and running, you need to apply the database migrations:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Access the application:

Your application will be running at :

```
http://<server_ip_or_host_domen>:8000
```
